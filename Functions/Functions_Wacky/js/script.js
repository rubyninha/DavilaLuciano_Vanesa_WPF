// Create a function that will calculate how many bunnies a female rabbit could have in a lifetime


//Prompt user to give age of their female rabbit

var yourBunny = prompt("Let's calculate how many bunnies your rabbit could have. Enter age of the female rabbit:");

// Validate using while loop
while(isNaN(yourBunny) || yourBunny==="") {
    //Re-prompt the user
    yourBunny = prompt("Please, enter your bunny's age in form of a number.");
}



// Create variable average for a litter in a rabbit's year

var litter = 72;


// Call the function
// Create a variable to "catch" the user input
var totalBunnies = calcBunnies(yourBunny, litter);

// Create a function that will calculate the total balance
// Create parameters for Function
function calcBunnies(b, l) {
    var bunnies = b * l;
    return bunnies;
}
console.log(totalBunnies);
